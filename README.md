# webgl-megu

This is just an active picture made by webgl for a virtual youtuber named shinonomemegu.\
And I'm just a fan of her.\
\
Because I'm not expert on it ,the code is NOT good. But it works.\
And the lib can't do something like unlinear transform, and only for 2D.\
The animation is very simple with only CPU.\
Maybe it will be better later, and maybe not.\
This is just for fun and megu.\
\
Here is the structure.\
\
Common: some necessary file for webgl, nothing special.\
\
Megu: main folder.\
  - megumayuge.html: just for fun lol.
  - megu.html: the final product.
\
Lib: some functions.\
  - animate.js: produce animation.
  - draw.js: some function for making it easier.
  - shape.js: compute the points of some shapes.
  - template.js: nothing special, it is to initialize webgl.
